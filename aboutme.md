subtitle: Why you'd want me to work for you
---

Hi! My name is Abel Hristodor (aka `iamnorte` on the web). I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I’m an introvert, but I speak fluently in code.

**Note:** one of the above is a lie. Can you guess which one?

What else do you need?

*Disclaimer: Don't take what you'll read too seriously.
It has been written jokingly... kind of*

## My story

Why me? To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't
you just watch me in **action** instead?

Between being an introvert who considers a **quiet weekend** the **ultimate** victory
(I mean, who needs loud crowds when you have peace and quiet?)
and mastering all things tech, I’m a **Cloud DevOps Engineer**
who loves automating everything, from pipelines to snacks (more on that later).

I started my journey in *Verona, Italy* ,
and somewhere along the way, I got **hooked** on making infrastructure efficient
and **secure**.

When I’m not optimizing costs or fine-tuning service meshes,
I’m probably pushing my home lab to its **limits** or dominating beach volleyball.

Curious yet? Me neither, but stick around for the plot.

> Fun fact: I use Nvim, so I can code faster than you can say
  “vim is hard.” <-- skill issue here

## Skills

- **Cloud Mastery**: Google Cloud (GKE, GCE, ALB), AWS (EKS, Lambda, EC2), Docker,
Kubernetes, Istio – *you name it, I’ve probably deployed it.*
- **CI/CD Wizardry**: Git, GitHub Actions, CircleCI – *my pipelines are smoother
than an Italian espresso.*
- **DevOps Enthusiast**: Terraform, ArgoCD, Helm, Service Meshes – *automating and
securing infrastructure is kind of my thing.*
- **Databases & Tools**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ – *I make data
persist, forever.*

---

## Languages

I talk a lot — less with people, more with machines!

- **Human Languages**: Italian, Romanian, English –
*I talk many languages, what did you expect?*
- **Non-Human Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Golang, Rust, Bash -
*and some others my laptop will remind me of when I forget!*

Hope you didn't expect me to give you the snack without the need **to work for it**!
At the end of the day we're programmers, sometimes the `recipe` to something
is **more important** than the `result` itself.

P.S. Yes i like cooking. Yes i love crepes.
