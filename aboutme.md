subtitle: Why you'd want me to work for you
---

Hi! My name is Abel Hristodor (aka `iamnorte` on the web). I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I’m an introvert, but I speak fluently in code.

What else do you need?

**Note:** one of the above is a lie. Can you guess which one?

It has been written jokingly... kind of*

## My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you
just watch me in action instead?

Between being extremely loyal to my family
(I mean, who else answers to their mom on the first call?)
and mastering all things tech, I’m a **Cloud DevOps Engineer**
who loves automating everything, from pipelines to snacks (more on that later)
(I'm not promising that, though).

I started my journey in *Verona, Italy* (which you should visit btw),
and somewhere along the way, I got hooked on making infrastructure efficient
and secure.

When I’m not optimizing costs or fine-tuning service meshes,
I’m probably pushing my home lab to its limits or dominating beach volleyball.

Curious yet? Me neither, but stick around for the plot.

## Skills

- **Cloud Mastery**: Google Cloud (GKE, GCE, ALB), AWS (EKS, Lambda, EC2), Docker,
Kubernetes, Istio – you name it, I’ve probably deployed it.
- **CI/CD Wizardry**: Git, GitHub Actions, CircleCI – my pipelines are smoother
than an Italian espresso.
- **DevOps Enthusiast**: Terraform, ArgoCD, Helm, Service Meshes – automating and
securing infrastructure is kind of my thing.
- **Databases & Tools**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ – I make data
persist, forever.

## Languages

I talk a lot — less with people, more with machines!

- **Human Languages**: Italian, Romanian, English –
I talk many languages, what did you expect?
- **Non-Human Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Golang, Rust, Bash,
and some others my laptop will remind me of when I forget!
